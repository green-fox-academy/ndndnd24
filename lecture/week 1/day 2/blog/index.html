                Persian Cats
            </h3>
            <p>
                The Persian cat (Persian: گربه ایرانی‎, romanized: Gorbe Īrānī) is a long-haired breed of cat
                characterized by its round face and short muzzle. It is also known as the "Persian Longhair" in the
                English-speaking countries. In the Middle East, region they are widely known as "Iranian cat" and in
                Iran they are known as "Shirazi cat". The first documented ancestors of the Persian were imported
                into
                Italy from Iran (historically known as Persia in the west) around 1620. Recognized by the cat fancy
                since the late 19th century, it was developed first by the English, and then mainly by American
                breeders
                after the Second World War. Some cat fancier organizations' breed standards subsume the Himalayan
                and
                Exotic Shorthair as variants of this breed, while others treat them as separate breeds. <br><br>
                The selective breeding carried out by breeders has allowed the development of a wide variety of coat
                colors, but has also led to the creation of increasingly flat-faced Persians. Favored by fanciers,
                this
                head structure can bring with it a number of health problems. As is the case with the Siamese breed,
                there have been efforts by some breeders to preserve the older type of cat, the traditional breed,
                having a more pronounced muzzle, which is more popular with the general public. Hereditary
                polycystic
                kidney disease is prevalent in the breed, affecting almost half the population in some
                countries.<br><br>
                In 2015 it was ranked as the 2nd most popular breed in the United States according to the Cat
                Fanciers'
                Association.The first is the Exotic breed.

            <h3>
                Russian Blue
            </h3>
            <p>
                The Russian Blue is a cat breed that comes in colors varying from a light shimmering silver to a
                darker,
                slate grey. They develop close bonds with their owners and are sought out as pets due to their
                personalities, beauty and coat. It is their short, dense coat which has been the hallmark of the
                Russian
                breed for more than a century. The dense coat stands out from the body and one can draw patterns in
                the
                coat that will stay until one smoothes them out again.

                Scottish Fold
            </h3>
            <p>
                The Scottish Fold is a breed of domestic cat with a natural dominant-gene mutation that affects
                cartilage throughout the body, causing the ears to "fold", bending forward and down towards the
                front of
                the head, which gives the cat what is often described as an "owl-like" appearance.<br><br>
                Originally called lop-eared or lops after the lop-eared rabbit, Scottish Fold became the breed's
                name in
                1966. Depending on registries, longhaired Scottish Folds are varyingly known as Highland Fold,
                Scottish
                Fold Longhair, Longhair Fold and Coupari.

            <h3>
                Maine Coon
            </h3>
            <p>
                The Maine Coon is the largest domesticated cat breed. It has a distinctive physical appearance and
                valuable hunting skills. It is one of the oldest natural breeds in North America, specifically
                native to
                the state of Maine, where it is the official state cat.<br><br>
                No records of the Maine Coon's exact origins and date of introduction to the United States exist, so
                several competing hypotheses have been suggested. The breed was popular in cat shows in the late
                19th
                century, but its existence became threatened when long-haired breeds from overseas were introduced
                in
                the early 20th century. The Maine Coon has since made a comeback and is now one of the more popular
                cat
                breeds in the USA. <br><br>
                The Maine Coon is a large and sociable cat, hence its nickname, "the gentle giant." It is
                characterized
                by a prominent ruff along its chest, robust bone structure, rectangular body shape, an uneven two
                layered coat with longer guard hairs with a silky satin under layer undercoat, and a long, bushy
                tail.
                The breed's colors vary widely, with only lilac and chocolate disallowed for pedigree. Reputed for
                its
                intelligence and playful, gentle personality, the Maine Coon is often cited as having "dog-like"
                characteristics. Professionals notice certain health problems in the breed including feline
                hypertrophic
                cardiomyopathy and hip dysplasia, but reputable breeders use modern screening methods to minimize
                the
                frequency of these problems.

            <h3>
                Bengal Cats
            </h3>
            <p>
                The Bengal cat is a domesticated cat breed created from hybrids of domestic cats, the Asian leopard
                cat
                (Prionailurus bengalensis) and the Egyptian Mau, which gives them their golden shimmer – the breed
                name
                comes from the taxonomic name. Back-crossing to domestic cats is then done with the goal of creating
                a
                healthy, and docile cat with wild-looking, high-contrast coat.<br><br>
                Bengals have a wild appearance and may show spots, rosettes, arrowhead markings, or marbling.
